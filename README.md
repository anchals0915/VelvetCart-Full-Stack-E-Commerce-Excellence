## 1. Introduction

The rise of e-commerce has significantly transformed business operations, as more companies move online to meet growing consumer demand for digital shopping. Providing a smooth, secure, and reliable online shopping experience is essential in today’s competitive digital market. While businesses have access to advanced tools and frameworks for building such platforms, challenges like scalability, security, and user experience persist.

VelvetCart addresses these challenges by offering a modern, scalable, and customizable solution designed for both small and large businesses. Leveraging technologies such as Spring Boot 3, Angular 18, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS, VelvetCart ensures a seamless and high-performance shopping experience. The platform is built to simplify the process of setting up a customizable online store, catering to diverse business needs while providing a smooth user experience.

### 1.1 Relevance of the Project
E-commerce has become a vital part of modern business, allowing companies to directly engage with consumers worldwide. With consumers expecting seamless and personalized experiences, the need for effective e-commerce platforms has become essential. However, existing platforms often struggle to provide high-quality user experiences due to issues like slow performance, poor scalability, and weak security.

VelvetCart aims to solve these problems by delivering a robust, flexible, and scalable e-commerce solution. Built with Spring Boot 3 for backend development, Angular 18 for frontend development, and PostgreSQL for database management, VelvetCart can handle growing traffic and products. The platform ensures user security through Kinde authentication and provides an aesthetically pleasing UI designed with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, ensuring a user-friendly experience across all devices.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Many existing e-commerce platforms, such as Shopify and WooCommerce, offer limited customization and scalability, which can be restrictive for growing businesses. These platforms often use pre-built templates that may not fully support the unique needs of a business, especially as they scale. Businesses frequently face limitations when adding features like personalized recommendations or customizing the checkout process without paying for costly plugins or services.

VelvetCart addresses these limitations by offering a fully customizable and scalable solution. Using Spring Boot, the platform is designed to easily integrate new features, such as personalized recommendations or multi-channel order management, while ensuring high performance. It is optimized to handle high traffic volumes without compromising speed or security, making it a suitable choice for businesses looking for growth and flexibility.

### 1.3 Objective
The core objective of VelvetCart is to create a fully functional, feature-rich e-commerce platform that businesses can rely on for their online stores. The platform will include essential e-commerce features such as product catalog management, user authentication, and order processing, all backed by secure payment handling. VelvetCart is built with a strong focus on flexibility, allowing businesses to customize the system as they see fit. The system’s backend will be powered by **Spring Boot**, a widely recognized framework known for its simplicity and robustness in handling complex business logic, making it ideal for building scalable e-commerce solutions.

On the frontend, **Angular 18** will be used to create a dynamic and highly interactive user interface. Angular offers powerful tools for building responsive and reactive web applications, allowing users to easily browse products, manage their carts, and complete transactions seamlessly. Data storage and management will be handled by **PostgreSQL**, an advanced relational database known for its reliability and performance. Additionally, **Kinde** authentication will ensure secure user login and registration, while **Tailwind CSS** and **Daisy UI** will make the platform visually appealing and mobile-friendly, ensuring a positive user experience across all devices.

### 1.4 Scope of the Project
The VelvetCart project covers both frontend and backend development, integrating essential e-commerce components like product management, order processing, and secure payment handling. The backend, built with Spring Boot, will manage business logic, while PostgreSQL handles data storage. The frontend will be developed with Angular 18, providing an interactive and responsive user interface. Key features include product browsing, shopping cart management, and secure payment processing.

Security is a key focus, with Kinde handling authentication to ensure the protection of sensitive user data. The project will also incorporate user account management and order tracking functionalities, offering a complete e-commerce experience.

### 1.5 Software Development Methodology
The project will follow an Agile development methodology, breaking down the work into manageable tasks with iterative sprints. Each sprint will focus on specific features, followed by testing and feedback loops to ensure alignment with user needs. Early development will focus on setting up the foundational systems, while later stages will refine the user interface and add additional features based on user input. Testing will be continuous, using automated tools like Playwright for end-to-end testing to ensure the platform is robust and optimized.
